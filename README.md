## Database

- <http://localhost:8080/h2-console/>
- This demo project use H2 db. If you want to change it, change the values of *application.yml*.
- For other databases like MySQL sequences don't work for ID generation. So you have to change the GenerationType in the
  entity beans to 'AUTO' or 'IDENTITY'.

I use this library:

<https://github.com/auth0/jwt-decode>

jwt-decode is a small browser library that helps to decode JWTs token which are Base64Url encoded.
